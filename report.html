      1. I met this requirement because my client is my father.<br>
      2. My site includes a heaeder which is the logo of the business.  The header is also included when the 
      width of the page goes into mobile.  The header becomes Tims Small Engine Repair.<br>
      3. Site contains 5 pages.  Home page gives basic info and location of business.  Location is generic location.  Not actual location
      of my house. Pricing/Rates gives breakdown of the pricing for working on the machine.  Background explains how business was started.  About is gives most 
      recent project.  Contact Us lets user put info in to email the business directly.<br>
      4.Navigation links to move from page to page are visible towards top of page.<br>
      5. Mobile version is visible when page width becomes 641px.  Another version when page becomes 440px.  I do this to not distort the items that are 
      on each page. <br>
      6. The favicon, h1, logo, and the navigation is all in the global.css because it needs to be the same for across all the pages for consistency.  Each page gets
      their own .css because it makes everything more organized.<br>
      7. alt's are used behind each image to briefly describe what the picture is.  All the slideshow images have it to say what the picture is.  Same with the 
      logo.<br>
      8. A little version of the logo is used for the favicon on the tab on the browser.<br>
      9. All the images/logos are located in images folder, css is in css folder and js is in js folder.<br>
      10. I am not using any libraries or frameworks.<br>
      11. <br>
      12. I have shared the URL.<br>
      13. All of the files are lowercase and contain the letters.<br>
      14. My site does work on 8443 port.<br>
      15. A lock symbol appears next to URL window at top of browser.<br>
      16. All my content is aligned the same on each page for consistency.  It makes the page look more appealing.<br>
      17. I use three different fonts.  One is from Google Fonts, one is regular sans serif and the other is Arial sans serif.<br>
      18. I have a contact us page that allows the user to input their name, email, subject of the message, and the content of the message. There is also a 
      submit button.<br>
      19. I have links to mainstream parts websites and a link to a Google Maps page where business is located(fictionally).<br>
      20. All the formatting is consistent and all names of the id and classes are meaningful for the content.<br>
      21. I have an animation for a slide show that fades the image in and out on the click of the previous or next button.<br>

      The overall look of the website is good. The oranges don't look the same from the logo and the background of the other parts.  In my(Noah's) eyes
      I can't tell the difference in the oranges.  Likes the slideshow and the contact us page.  Wishes there were more images to insert.  Wants to add more info
      regarding the installation of performance products.  Add images of other small engine vehicles.  Include that we use quality filters and oils.  No cheap stuff.
      Told me to add something about restorations of older snowmobiles. Add something about custom wraps.  Maybe more photos.  <br>
      These were the critiques they he gave and I made the changes in the website.
