    <div class="info">
        <p>This started in the garage and has slowly grown from the great reviews
            that people have given us about our work. We take great pride in the work that
            we do and the importance of the customers to help grow our business.</p>
        <p>This shop started in early 2018, when Tim decided he could make money from working on other people's machines.  After many years working on his own
            equiqment, he became very familiar with the process and techniques needed to fix and work on engines.  A lot people that have small engine vehicles are not very 
            mechanical when it comes to engines.
